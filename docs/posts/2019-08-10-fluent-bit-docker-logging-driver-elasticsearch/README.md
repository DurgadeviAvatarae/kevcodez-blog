# Logging from Docker Services to Elasticsearch with Fluent Bit

In this guide I'd like to show you how to setup the lightweight log processor and forwarder [Fluent Bit](https://fluentbit.io/) as docker logging driver to catch all `stdout` produced by your containers, process the logs, and forward them to Elasticsearch.

[Twelve-Factor](https://12factor.net/) says the following about Logs

> A twelve-factor app never concerns itself with routing or storage of its output stream. It should not attempt to write to or manage logfiles.
> Instead, each running process writes its event stream, unbuffered, to stdout.
> During local development, the developer will view this stream in the foreground of their terminal to observe the appâ€™s behavior.

Rather than configuring your applications to send logs to your log storage (Elasticsearch/Graylog/...) or even write log files itself, your applications should simply log to `stdout`.

In a dockerized environment with multiple services, where each container is isolated and logs on it's own, we need an interface to collect those logs.
**Docker Logging Driver** to the rescue.
Each docker daemon has a logging driver, which each container uses.
That way, each log entry will flow through the logging driver, enabling us to process and forward it.

## Fluent Bit vs Fluentd

A popular library to solve this is [Fluentd](https://www.fluentd.org/). An open source log collector, processor and aggregator written in Ruby, first published in 2011.

Fluent Bit is an open source log collector created by the same folgs, written in C, first published in 2015.

Taken from the [official documentation](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/v/1.2/about/fluentd_and_fluentbit).

Regarding ecosystem, Fluentd is a lot more mature and adpoted.
However, Fluent Bit takes about 1/10 of the resources and does offer plugins for standard tooling.

For simple cases that involve standard tooling (like Elasticsearch) and don't focus on aggregation and rather on processing and forwarding, I'd recommend using Fluentbit.

## Getting started with Fluent Bit

Fluent Bit offers official production-ready docker images.
For a detailed list check [the official docs](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/installation/docker).

Fluent Bit can be configured by file or command line.
We will go for configuration by file.

There are different sections of configuration:

- [Service](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/service) - defines the global behavior of the Fluent Bit engine
- [Input](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/input) - defines the source from where Fluent Bit can collect data
- [Parser](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/parser) - take unstructured log entries and give them structure
- [Filter](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/filter) - allows to alter the incoming data generated by the input plugins
- [Output](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/output) - defines where Fluent Bit should flush the information it gathers from the input

Let's take a look at an example configuration.

```apacheconf
[SERVICE]
	log_level debug

# The stdin plugin allows to retrieve valid JSON text messages over the standard input interface (stdin)
[INPUT]
	Name stdin

# The Record Modifier Filter plugin allows to append fields or to exclude specific fields.
[FILTER]
	Name record_modifier
	Match *
	Record hostname ${HOSTNAME}

# The stdout output plugin allows to print to the standard output the data received through the input plugin.
[OUTPUT]
	Name stdout
```

Building a custom Fluent Bit Docker Image is fairly simple

```Dockerfile
FROM fluent/fluent-bit:1.2
ADD fluent-bit.conf /fluent-bit/etc/
```

Let's test our simple configuration.

## Fluent Bit as Docker Driver

For Fluent Bit to receive every log produced by a container to process and forward, we need to setup Fluent Bit as Docker Logging Driver.

We need to use the **forward** input plugin for Fluent Bit.
Forward is the protocol used by Fluent Bit and Fluentd to route messages between peers. This plugin implements the input service to listen for Forward messages.
To check if everything is running just fine, we will keep the `stdout` plugin for now.

```apacheconf
[SERVICE]
    log_level debug

[INPUT]
    Name forward
    unix_path /var/run/fluent.sock
    Listen 0.0.0.0
    Port 24224

# Fluent Bit offers built-in parsers for *Apache*, *Nginx*, *Docker*, *Syslog rfc5424* and *Syslog rfc3164*.
# For the sake of simplicy, we will launch a default nginx image as docker container to collect some logs from.
[FILTER]
    Name filter-nginx
    Match **
    Parser nginx

[OUTPUT]
    Name stdout
```

Let's build a new docker image with the configuration above and start a container.

```shell
docker build -t fluentbit:driver-stdout .
docker run -it fluentbit:driver-stdout
```

To use an alternative logging driver, we can simply pass a `--log-driver` argument when starting the container.
This can be configured globally aswell. Refer to the [Docker Docs](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/configure/).

```shell
docker run -it --log-driver=fluentd nginx
```

## Send logs to Elasticsearch

To forward the Logs to Elasticsearch, we simply have to change the output plugin.
Fluent Bit comes with an [Elasticsearch Output Plugin](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/output/elasticsearch) built-in.

```apacheconf
[OUTPUT]
Name es
    Match **
    Host 127.0.0.1
    Port 9243
    # When Logstash_Format is enabled, the Index name is composed using a prefix and the date
    Logstash_Format True
    # HTTP_User <user>
    # HTTP_Passwd <pw>
    # Alternative time key, useful if your log entries contain an @timestamp field that is used by Elasticsearch
    # Time_Key es_time
    # If your Elasticsearch is using TLS, configure this
    # tls On
    # tls.verify Off
```

Let's spin up Elasticsearch, Fluent Bit and our sample nginx application.

```sh

```

Let's check if our logs arrived in Elasticsearch

```

```

Since we configured the logging level in Fluent Bit to _debug_, we should also see the forwarding in action:

```

```

That's it. The docker application simply uses stdout, the docker logging driver forwards the logs to Fluent Bit. Fluent Bit parses the entries and forwards them to Elasticsearch.
