Amazon recently [announced the support for version 6.3](https://aws.amazon.com/de/about-aws/whats-new/2018/08/amazon_elasticsearch_service_announces_support_for_elasticsearch_versions_5-6_and_6-3/) (and 5.6) for AWS Elasticsearch.

They also improved the upgrade mechanism to automatically upgrade Elasticsearch clusters with zero downtime, without any hustle on your side.

See the [official blog postÂ ](https://aws.amazon.com/de/blogs/database/in-place-version-upgrades-for-amazon-elasticsearch-service/)for instructions on how to do in-place version upgrades. You won't need to do any upgrades manually from now on.
